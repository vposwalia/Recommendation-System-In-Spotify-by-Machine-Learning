This section of the project focuses on building a music recommendation system using machine learning and the Spotify Web API. The system leverages K-Means clustering to group songs and genres based on audio features, and it recommends similar songs to a user based on their listening history.

To develop a recommendation system, one can leverage the inherent clustering of similar genres and songs within those genres. This is intuitive as songs of the same genre often share similarities in sound and time periods. Utilizing this observation, a recommendation system can be constructed by analyzing the proximity of data points representing songs.

Spotipy, a Python client for the Spotify Web API, facilitates the retrieval of data and querying of Spotify's extensive song catalog. To get started, install Spotipy using the command "pip install spotipy". Following installation, it is essential to create a Spotify Developer app, obtaining a unique Client ID and secret key to authenticate API requests.
