# Spotify Data Analysis and Clustering
This repository contains code for analyzing and clustering music data using machine learning techniques. We utilized Python, scikit-learn, and Plotly Express to explore and visualize the characteristics of songs and genres.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the notebook spotifyvisualisation.ipynb, we conducted an exploratory data analysis of the music dataset. Key visualizations include:

<h3>Distribution of song features (acousticness, danceability, energy, etc.).</h3>
Trends in music characteristics over time.
Number of songs per decade.
<h3>Genre Analysis Over Time</h3>
In the notebook, we analyzed the characteristics of different music genres over time. Notable visualizations include:

<h3>Count of songs per decade for various genres.</h3>
Customized bar chart comparing characteristics of the top 10 genres.
<h3>K-Means Clustering of Genres</h3>>
We applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to group music genres based on their audio features. The clusters were visualized using t-SNE for a 2D representation.

<h3>K-Means Clustering of Songs</h3>
We performed K-Means clustering on individual songs, considering various audio features. The clusters were visualized using PCA for a 2D representation.
